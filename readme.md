# Technology Solution for the Realm Platform

## Philosophy

The **Realm** platform follows the recommendations of the [MACH Alliance](https://machalliance.org/about). MACH is an industry tech standard describing modern technology.

The prerequisites to achieve this standard are:

- **M**icroservices - These are individually-developed functions that are managed and launched independently. They allow engineers to be language and technology agnostic and to work on services without disrupting overall workflows. Examples for **Realm** are: 1. [Login Authentication - Auth0](https://auth0.com). 2. [Listings/Bookings - Sharetribe](https://sharetribe.com). 3. [Payments - Stripe](https://stripe.com)

- **A**PI-first – This means taking a product-centric approach to developing APIs, where they operate as separate products rather than integrations which form part of other systems. The result is a set of modular, interoperable APIs which come together to form an API platform that allows for rapid development and innovation.
- **C**loud-native SaaS – Software as a Service (SaaS) Cloud services are essential for digital transformations and apps designed and built to exploit the scale, elasticity, resiliency, and flexibility of the cloud and allow engineers to easily make frequent, high-impact changes with minimal downtime.
- **H**eadless – This means the back-end logic and front-end user experience are completely decoupled, or disconnected, which offers brands complete control over managing their own user interface and can be connected to virtually any system they already have in place.

The advantages for **Realm** of an open and best-of-breed enterprise technology ecosystem that the MACH Alliance advocates are:

- **Flexibility**: we can choose the cloud services we want based on our unique requirements and context allowing for easy customization and speedy changes. In the future each of the cloud services can be built in-house to remove the cost or migrated to other cheaper or more improved providers.
- **Resourcefulness**: the flexibility to choose only required cloud services and only when we require them.
- **Best-of-breed**: Best-of-breed, implying a collection of expert applications doing one thing really well, can improve quality and agility.
- **Developer focus**: MACH supports being developer-first, which allows a single developer to easily integrate each cloud service, with sample code and examples always provided.
- **Speed**: MACH-based cloud services allow us to scale infinitely with all services delivered from the edge, meaning as close as possible to our end customers for the shortest latency.
